# Project Rules

## Change Numbering System

All changes made to this project are automatically numbered with the format: `01-`, `02-`, `03-`, etc.

Each change will be:
- Tracked in `/CHANGELOG.md`
- Numbered sequentially starting from 01-
- Documented with a description and timestamp

The current change number is tracked in `.project/change-tracker.json`.
