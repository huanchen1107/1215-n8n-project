# Project Context

## Purpose
This project is an n8n-related development project established on December 15th (1215). It aims to manage and automate workflows or related integrations.

## Tech Stack
- **Core**: HTML, JavaScript
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (unless Tailwind is requested)
- **Runtime**: Node.js (implied by npm usage)
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Automation**: n8n (implied by project name)

## Project Conventions

### Code Style
- **Aesthetics**: Prioritize rich, premium aesthetics (glassmorphism, vibrant colors, smooth animations).
- **Structure**: Use semantic HTML and modular JavaScript.
- **Naming**: Clear, descriptive variable and function names.

### Architecture Patterns
- Component-based architecture for web views.
- Modular workflow design for n8n integrations.

### Testing Strategy
- Verify all changes locally before committing.
- Ensure responsive design for web interfaces.

### Git Workflow
- **Automatic Change Numbering**: All changes must be numbered sequentially (e.g., `01-`, `02-`).
- **Commits**: Commit messages must reference the change number (e.g., `01- Initialize project`).
- **Main Branch**: `master`.

## Domain Context
- Understanding of n8n workflows and node development may be required.
- Focus on premium user experience and visual polish.

## Important Constraints
- **Execution Policy**: Windows PowerShell execution policy requires `RemoteSigned` or `Bypass`.
- **Privacy**: Use `16698007+huanchen1107@users.noreply.github.com` for git commits.

## External Dependencies
- **@fission-ai/openspec**: Used for managing specifications and AI agent workflows.
